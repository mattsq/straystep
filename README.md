<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of straystep is to add a recipes:: step for the HDOutliers
implementation stray::

It’s basically an experiment for me of building a step that’s only used
at train time, not inference.

It almost certainly doesn’t work yet\!

## Installation

straystep:: is not on CRAN\!

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mattsq/straystep")
```

## More

I’ll add more here once the package actually… definitely works.
